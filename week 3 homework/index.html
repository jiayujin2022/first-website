		<strong>Why am I here? 
		
I am here to improve myself, be educated, and learn valuable knowledge so that I won’t be so blind and ignorant to live out my life.

		<strong>
		What is procrastination? 
		
Ted talk speaker Tim Urban said the crazy monkey was controlling the body. Yes, in the last ten years. I was doing all sorts of stupid things, video games, alcohol, drug, gambling, etc. what are they all in common? Instant gratification without long-term rational planning. So, what should I do about it? As the speaker in the ted talk indicated, think about the fear. He not only demonstrates that a deadline is a way to allow the rational guy in our brain to take control of the body, but he also creates a paper full of boxes, each box representing a weekly task. How many boxes can we tick in one’s lifetime? Not so many, to be honest. Oh man, fear is a powerful tool to stop procrastination. I want to live in a fuller life. So stop procrastinating.

		<strong>
		What is Intelligence? 
		
Hamilton pointed out that there are multiple intelligences, such as spatial, verbal, mathematical, kinaesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalistic, pedagogical etc. I did some research; they are highly correlated. Intelligence is speed; how fast do you learn something? It is stable throughout your life. However, when people are over 25 years old, it starts to decline, and the efficient way to slow it down is through physical exercise because it can keep the brain clean and oxygenated.

		<strong>
		Can learning new stuff help? 
		
Hamilton said the brain is like a muscle; it gets stronger and works better if you stretch yourself to learn something new. It has already been proved in animal studies as the brain grows when challenged.

		<strong>
		So Keep learning and keep exercising. To do this, STOP Procrastinating!
